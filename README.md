Just another repository

Hello all! I am trying to find the magic bullet that will allow me to import JSON to Google Sheets and commit the data to the same columns repeatedly without having the data move around with each import, since JSON is an unstructured format. Then. run queries against the imported data from other google sheets. I'd like to this without going down the rabbit hole of learning python. AND...I don't know a whole lot of programming to begin with. Just some SQL queries and a lot of Google Sheets formulas. Wish me luck!
